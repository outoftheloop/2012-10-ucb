Bundles and whole distributions
-------------------------------

The following can be your "one-stop shopping" destinations for getting
up-and-running with a whole ecosystems of tools.

- `Python (x,y) <http://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/>`__ - Windows,
  experimental Linux support.

- `Scipy Superpack <http://fonnesbeck.github.com/ScipySuperpack/>`__ - Mac OS
  X (recent version only).

- `Sage <http://www.sagemath.org/>`__ - not only does it ship with the
  tools we discussed, but also many others, both numerical and symbolic. "The
  Borg" which assimilates  `nearly 100 open-source packages`_ and features a
  unified interface. (cross-platform)

.. _nearly 100 open-source packages: http://www.sagemath.org/links-components.html

- `Enthought Python Distribution (EPD)
  <http://www.enthought.com/products/getepd.php>`__ - Free for academics
  (temporarily not available), `EPD Free
  <http://www.enthought.com/products/epd_free.php>`__ has no cost to anyone,
  and  has the basics you off the ground. (cross-platform)

- `Anaconda <https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda>`__ Community Edition
  is free, Pro version available. (cross-platform)

Drafting notes
--------------

St√©fan: We can flip open the  `IPython sympy notebook.`_.. show the `galleries for
skimage,`_  `sklearn`_.  I can run through the  `SciPy docs`_.

    sjvdwalt: What we are thinking is always worth writing down
    sjvdwalt: Actually, scratch that
    pi: Are you sure?
    pi: I think with version control, this will be one for the history books.
    pi: I think with version control, this will be one for the history books.
    sjvdwalt: Or at least for `git blame`
    pi: ahh, but I could doctor that, as well, Dr.
